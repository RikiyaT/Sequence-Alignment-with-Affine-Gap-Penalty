# Sequence Alignment with Affine Gap Penalty

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook `main.ipynb`, which implements a sequence alignment algorithm using the Needleman-Wunsch approach with affine gap penalties.

## Features

- Accepts DNA sequences in FASTA format.
- Implements sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.
- Incorporates affine gap penalties, with separate penalties for gap opening and extension.
- Outputs alignment score and the aligned sequences.

## Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Biopython's SeqIO for parsing FASTA files
- Tabulate for formatting output
